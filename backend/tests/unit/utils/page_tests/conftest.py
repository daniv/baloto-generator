"""
Configure cross-game page-object tests and their shared infrastructure.

This module coordinates game parametrization, external test resources,
Playwright lifecycle management, and lottery result-page construction.

The architecture separates the test workflow into the following concerns:

* Select the lottery games applicable to each test through ``crossgames``,
  ``only_game``, ``skip_game``, and the ``--game`` command-line option.
* Generate only the required game-specific test cases during collection.
* Represent each scenario as an immutable ``GameTestCase`` containing the
  selected game, expected-result key, expected values, and HTML content.
* Load expected-result JSON files and mocked HTML through ``GameCaseLoader``.
* Provide one Playwright browser context shared by the test module.
* Create an isolated empty Playwright page for each test execution.
* Load the active case HTML through the dedicated ``case_page`` fixture.
* Provide an independent mutable copy of expected values through
  ``expected_result``.
* Construct the result-page implementation associated with the active game.

The execution flow is:

1. ``pytest_generate_tests`` determines the games that must be executed.
2. ``GameCaseLoader`` loads the expected values and mocked HTML resources.
3. ``game_case`` exposes the validated immutable ``GameTestCase``.
4. ``page`` creates an isolated empty Playwright page.
5. ``case_page`` loads ``game_case.html_content`` into that page.
6. ``result_page_factory`` creates the game-specific implementation using the
   Playwright page selected by the test.
7. ``expected_result`` exposes a mutable deep copy of the expected values.
8. The test compares the page-object result with its expected result.

The design follows the SOLID principles:

* Single Responsibility Principle:
  game selection, resource loading, browser management, page lifecycle, HTML
  loading, expected-result copying, and page-object construction are handled
  by separate components.
* Open/Closed Principle:
  additional games and test scenarios can be introduced without changing the
  resource-loading and browser-management workflow.
* Liskov Substitution Principle:
  every supported result-page implementation can be consumed through the
  common ``ResultPage`` contract.
* Interface Segregation Principle:
  fixtures and tests receive only the data and dependencies they require.
* Dependency Inversion Principle:
  test infrastructure depends on explicit case, loader, and factory
  abstractions instead of loading external resources directly inside tests.
