    Download and validate the HTML document for a specific lottery draw.

    The website may return its home page with a successful HTTP status when a
    requested draw does not exist. The function therefore validates both the
    final response URL and the draw identifier contained in the returned HTML.

    The caller can handle a missing draw independently from network failures:

        ...     return None

    :param url: Complete draw-result URL requested from the website.
    :param expected_game_id: Draw identifier expected in the returned document.
    :param timeout_seconds: Maximum request duration in seconds.
    :return: Validated response body decoded as text.
    :raises httpx.HTTPError: If the request fails or returns an unsuccessful
        HTTP status.
    :raises DrawPageNotFoundError: If the website redirects to another page or
        returns HTML that does not represent the requested draw.
